Analyzing SAT score of NYC Schools

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. 

SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City

School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City

Class size - Information on class size for each school

AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)

Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information

Demographics - Demographic information for each school

School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.
